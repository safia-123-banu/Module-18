# Ex. No: 18E - Count the Number of Triangles in an Undirected Graph

## AIM:
To write a Python program to **count the number of triangles** present in an **undirected graph** using matrix operations.

## ALGORITHM:

**Step 1**: Initialize a matrix `aux2` to store the square of the adjacency matrix (i.e., `graph²`).  
Also, initialize a matrix `aux3` to store the cube of the adjacency matrix (i.e., `graph³`).

**Step 2**: Multiply the adjacency matrix with itself to compute `aux2 = graph × graph`.

**Step 3**: Multiply `aux2` with the adjacency matrix again to compute `aux3 = aux2 × graph`.

**Step 4**: Compute the **trace** of the matrix `aux3` (i.e., the sum of diagonal elements of the matrix).

**Step 5**: Divide the trace by **6** to get the number of triangles in the graph.  
*(Each triangle is counted six times in the trace — twice per vertex and once per direction.)*

**Step 6**: Return the result.

## PYTHON PROGRAM

```
class AdjNode:
	def __init__(self, data):
		self.vertex = data
		self.next = None


# A class to represent a graph. A graph
# is the list of the adjacency lists.
# Size of the array will be the no. of the
# vertices "V"
class Graph:
	def __init__(self, vertices):
		self.V = vertices
		self.graph = [None] * self.V

	# Function to add an edge in an undirected graph
	def add_edge(self, src, dest):
		# Adding the node to the source node
		node = AdjNode(dest)
		node.next = self.graph[src]
		self.graph[src] = node

		# Adding the source node to the destination as
		# it is the undirected graph
		node = AdjNode(src)
		node.next = self.graph[dest]
		self.graph[dest] = node

	
	def print_graph(self):
	    for i in range(V):
	        print(f"Adjacency list of vertex {i}\n head",end=" ")
	        temp=self.graph[i]
	        while temp:
	            print(f"-> {temp.vertex}",end=" ")
	            temp=temp.next
	        print("\n")
	            
		
		
		#Write Code here





# Driver program to the above graph class
if __name__ == "__main__":
	V = 5
	graph = Graph(V)
	graph.add_edge(0, 1)
	graph.add_edge(0, 4)
	graph.add_edge(1, 2)
	graph.add_edge(1, 3)
	graph.add_edge(1, 4)
	graph.add_edge(2, 3)
	graph.add_edge(3, 4)

	graph.print_graph()
