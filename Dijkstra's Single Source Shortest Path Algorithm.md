# Ex. No: 18C - Dijkstra's Single Source Shortest Path Algorithm

## AIM:
To write a Python program for **Dijkstra's single source shortest path algorithm**.

## ALGORITHM:

**Step 1**: Initialize a `distance[]` array with infinity for all vertices except the source, which is set to `0`.  
Create a `sptSet[]` array (shortest path tree set) to keep track of vertices whose shortest distance from the source is finalized.

**Step 2**: Pick the vertex `u` with the minimum distance value from the set of vertices not yet processed.

**Step 3**: For every adjacent vertex `v` of the picked vertex `u`, if the current distance to `v` is greater than the distance to `u` plus the edge weight `(u, v)`, then update the distance of `v`.

**Step 4**: Mark the vertex `u` as processed in `sptSet`.

**Step 5**: Repeat Steps 2â€“4 until all vertices are processed.

**Step 6**: Print the shortest distances from the source to all other vertices.

## PYTHON PROGRAM

```
from collections import defaultdict

# This class represents a directed graph
# using adjacency list representation
class Graph:

	# Constructor
	def __init__(self):

		# default dictionary to store graph
		self.graph = defaultdict(list)

	# function to add an edge to graph
	def addEdge(self,u,v):
		self.graph[u].append(v)

	# Function to print a BFS of graph
	def BFS(self, s):

		# Mark all the vertices as not visited
		visited = [False] * (max(self.graph) + 1)

		# Create a queue for BFS
		queue = []

		# Mark the source node as
		# visited and enqueue it
		queue.append(s)
		visited[s] = True

		while queue:
		    s=queue.pop(0)
		    print(s,end=" ")
		    
		    for i in self.graph[s]:
		        if visited[i]==False:
		            queue.append(i)
		            visited[i]=True
		
		
		
		

# Create a graph given in
# the above diagram
n=int(input())
g = Graph()
g.addEdge(0, 1)
g.addEdge(0, 2)
g.addEdge(1, 2)
g.addEdge(2, 0)
g.addEdge(2, 3)
g.addEdge(3, 3)

print ("Following is Breadth First Traversal"
				" (starting from vertex {})".format(n))
g.BFS(n)

```
